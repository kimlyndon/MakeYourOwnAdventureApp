# Make Your Own Adventure App
## Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree UIKit Fundamentals (Navigation)

Build an app in storyboard using navigation controllers. Create a story that comes to a "fork in the road" and provide two choices for the user to decide in which direction the story will go. Once a choice is made, the story continues based on that choice and comes to another fork where two more choices are available. 

My six year old daughter created the story within this app along with the choices provided. This was a fun learning and bonding experience for both of us and this has become one of my favorite apps for this reason as well as the simplicity of building it.
